# Procedural-Generation-Unreal-Engine
Procedural generation of meshes on a landscape in the Unreal Engine. I built this project to improve my understanding of Unreal Engine and C++ integration. It has been really useful in open world landscape generation. Check out the code, and check out my portfolio site for the full description. 

To use this project in the Unreal Engine, create a blueprint instance of the project, and choose which mesh you would like to attach to the project. The .h file can be modified to attach multiple meshes.
